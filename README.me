The scope and accessibility of class members (i.e., variables and methods) can be controlled through the use of access modifiers. 

There are three main access modifiers in OOP: public, protected, and private. 

Public members can be accessed by any code, protected members can be accessed by the class and its subclasses, and private members can only be accessed by the class in which they are defined. 

These access modifiers help to encapsulate the internal details of a class, making it more stable and less prone to errors as the code changes over time.

Static members are class-level member that shared by all the instances. 

They are created and exist independently of any instance, they are always in memory while the program runs. 

Static members are useful when you need to maintain a shared state or behavior across all instances of a class.
